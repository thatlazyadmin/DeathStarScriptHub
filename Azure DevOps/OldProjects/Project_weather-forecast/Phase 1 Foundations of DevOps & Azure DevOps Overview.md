# Phase 1: Foundations of DevOps & Azure DevOps Overview

## DevOps Concepts

- **Definition**: DevOps is a combination of development (Dev) and operations (Ops) focused on continuous delivery, collaboration, and automation. The goal is to shorten development cycles, increase deployment frequency, and provide dependable releases.
- **Practical Use**: Reduces time-to-market for applications by allowing continuous feedback and improvement.

### How to Start:
- **Lab Task**: Install essential tools like Visual Studio Code, Git, and Docker to set up a local DevOps environment.

#### Step-by-Step:
1. **Install Visual Studio Code**: Download and install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. **Install Git**: Install Git and configure basic settings:
   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"
    ```
3. **Set up Docker Desktop:** Install Docker Desktop for containerized development. Ensure Docker is running and configured.

### Configure Agile Board:
- Set up an Agile board using Kanban or Scrum in Azure Boards to manage and track your projectâ€™s progress.

## Azure DevOps Instruction
- **Definition:** Azure DevOps is a cloud-based service by Microsoft that provides a comprehensive DevOps suite including Repos, Pipelines, Boards, and Artifacts.
- **Use Case:** Use Azure DevOps to manage code, run builds, track work, and release applications, providing an end-to-end DevOps solution.

### Configuration:
- **Lab Task:** Create an Azure DevOps organization and setup a new project

### Step-by-Step:
1. **Go to Azure DevOps:** Visit [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) and create an account if you don't already have one.
2. **Create an Organization:** Choose a name for your organization, such as "MyDevOpsOrg".
3. **Create a Project:** Inside the organization, create a new project, such as "MyFirstProject", to start organizing repositories, pipelines, and boards for your DevOps workflows.
