# Step 5: Monitor and Optimize

## Set Up Application Insights

1. **Enable Application Insights**:
   - Go to your App Service in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - In the left-hand menu, select **Application Insights** and enable monitoring.
   - This will automatically integrate Application Insights with your App Service, providing insights into application performance and error tracking.

2. **Monitor App Performance and Errors**:
   - With Application Insights enabled, you can monitor response times, failure rates, and other key performance indicators.
   - Configure alerts within Application Insights for critical metrics such as high response times or error rates.

## Add Logging to Azure DevOps Pipelines

1. **Configure Logging in Azure DevOps**:
   - In your CI/CD pipeline configurations, enable logging for each stage of the build, test, and deployment processes.
   - Logs help you track the status of each job and quickly diagnose issues when builds or deployments fail.

2. **Review Pipeline Logs for Performance Insights**:
   - Regularly review logs in Azure DevOps to understand pipeline performance.
   - Identify bottlenecks, test failures, or deployment issues by analyzing the logs, helping to optimize and improve pipeline efficiency.

By implementing monitoring and logging, you gain full visibility into application health and pipeline performance, making it easier to identify and resolve issues.
