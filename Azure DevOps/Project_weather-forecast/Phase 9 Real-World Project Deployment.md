# Phase 9: Real-World Project Deployment

## Lab Task: Deploy a Full Project from Code to Production

### Goal
The objective of this phase is to integrate all the previous DevOps concepts into a unified, real-world deployment workflow. By combining Repos, Pipelines, Boards, and Artifacts, you’ll create a cohesive DevOps pipeline that manages code, automates testing and deployment, manages dependencies, and tracks progress through a production-ready CI/CD setup.

### Step-by-Step

1. **Set Up Repositories and Source Control**:
   - Organize your project code in Azure Repos or GitHub.
   - Define a branching strategy (e.g., feature, development, and main branches) to maintain structured development.

2. **Implement CI Pipeline**:
   - Create a **build pipeline** to compile, test, and package the application automatically upon commits to designated branches.
   - Include automated tests and code quality checks, and store packages or artifacts in **Azure Artifacts**.

3. **Set Up CD Pipeline with Stages**:
   - Design a **release pipeline** with stages for **Dev**, **QA**, and **Production** environments.
   - Implement deployment tasks specific to each environment, such as deploying to Azure App Service, Virtual Machines, or AKS.

4. **Configure Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**:
   - Use ARM or Bicep templates to set up your infrastructure. This includes provisioning resources like databases, storage, and compute services in a version-controlled, repeatable way.
   - Integrate the IaC deployment into the pipeline to ensure infrastructure is provisioned consistently.

5. **Integrate Monitoring and Security**:
   - Configure **Application Insights** to monitor application performance and setup alerts for critical metrics.
   - Add **DevSecOps** practices, such as security checks in pipelines and Azure Key Vault for secrets management.

6. **Use Azure Boards for Tracking and Management**:
   - Create tasks, user stories, and bug-tracking items within Azure Boards to monitor project progress.
   - Link pull requests and code changes to work items, creating full traceability from development to deployment.

### Final Step: Document the Project

1. **Create Documentation**:
   - Document the project structure, workflow, and configurations in a comprehensive README file or documentation portal.
   
2. **Include Architecture Diagrams**:
   - Design and include diagrams showing the overall architecture, infrastructure layout, and DevOps pipeline stages. Highlight connections between components (e.g., Repos, Pipelines, AKS).

3. **Pipeline Configurations**:
   - Provide details of pipeline YAML configurations for both CI and CD stages, specifying tasks, dependencies, and any configurations for the environments.

4. **Outline Best Practices Observed**:
   - Summarize key DevOps best practices used throughout the project, such as:
     - Version control strategy
     - Consistent use of IaC
     - Security and monitoring practices
     - Deployment strategy for production readiness

By following this end-to-end workflow, you’ll create a fully functional DevOps project ready for real-world application, with the added benefit of comprehensive documentation for continued maintenance and improvement.
