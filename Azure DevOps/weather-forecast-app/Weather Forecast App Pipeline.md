# Project: Weather Forecast App Pipeline

## Description
This project involves creating a simple weather forecasting application using **Python** (or **Node.js** for those who prefer JavaScript) that retrieves data from a weather API and displays it on a web page. The primary goal is to use **Azure DevOps** to automate the CI/CD pipeline, containerize the app using **Docker**, and deploy it to **Azure App Service**.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name**: Weather Forecast App

### Technologies Used
- **Python/Node.js**: Backend development
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend design
- **Azure DevOps**: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD)
- **Docker**: Application containerization
- **Azure App Service**: Application deployment

### Learning Objectives
This project will help you learn how to:
1. **Set up Source Control**:
   - Use **GitHub** or **Azure Repos** to manage code versioning and collaboration.
2. **Create an Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline**:
   - Build an automated pipeline in Azure DevOps to manage application testing, building, and deployment processes.
3. **Automate Testing**:
   - Integrate automated testing in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure code quality and functionality.
4. **Containerize the App with Docker**:
   - Use Docker to containerize the application for consistent deployment across environments.
5. **Deploy the App to Azure App Service**:
   - Deploy the containerized application to **Azure App Service** to make it publicly accessible.

This project provides a hands-on introduction to key DevOps practices, giving you practical experience in source control, CI/CD, testing, containerization, and cloud deployment with Azure DevOps and Azure App Service.
