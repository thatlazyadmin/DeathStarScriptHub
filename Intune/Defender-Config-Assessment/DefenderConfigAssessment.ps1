Synopsis:
This script connects to Microsoft Graph and retrieves the configuration settings for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, including antivirus settings and Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules. It evaluates these settings against Microsoft's best practices and exports the results to a CSV file for analysis. The purpose of this script is to help administrators ensure that their Defender for Endpoint configurations are aligned with recommended security practices.
