# Project Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for the Azure VM Provisioning Workspace project, which allows end users to request Azure Virtual Machines through a Power Apps Canvas form, mirroring the Azure Portal's "Create VM" experience.

## Functional Requirements
1. **User Interface**:
   - A Power Apps Canvas application that provides a user-friendly interface for VM provisioning.
   - A React component for the VM creation form that handles user input, validation, and submission.

2. **API**:
   - An API for provisioning virtual machines, including:
     - Functions to handle requests for VM creation.
     - Endpoints to fetch available SKUs and images.
     - Validation of VM names to ensure compliance with Azure naming conventions.

3. **Infrastructure**:
   - Bicep and ARM templates for provisioning the necessary Azure resources, including:
     - Virtual Machines (VMs)
     - Network Interface Cards (NICs)
     - OS disks

## Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**:
   - The application should respond to user requests within an acceptable time frame (e.g., under 2 seconds for API calls).

2. **Security**:
   - Implement authentication and authorization for the API to ensure that only authorized users can provision VMs.
   - Secure sensitive data, such as API keys and connection strings.

3. **Scalability**:
   - The architecture should support scaling to handle increased load, particularly during peak usage times.

4. **Maintainability**:
   - Code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

## Dependencies
- **Node.js**: Required for running the API and frontend applications.
- **Azure SDK for JavaScript**: For interacting with Azure services.
- **React**: For building the frontend components.
- **Power Apps**: For creating the Canvas application.
- **Bicep/ARM**: For infrastructure as code.

## Prerequisites
- An Azure subscription to provision resources.
- Access to Power Apps for creating and managing the Canvas application.
- Development environment set up with Node.js and necessary libraries installed.

## Testing
- Unit tests for API endpoints and frontend components.
- Integration tests to ensure that the entire workflow from the UI to the API and Azure provisioning works as expected.

## Documentation
- Comprehensive documentation covering setup, usage, and troubleshooting should be provided to assist users and developers.
